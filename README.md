Classic Bluetooth is for high-bandwidth, continuous connections (like audio streaming) needing more power, while Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is for low-power, intermittent data (like sensors, wearables) using small bursts, offering longer battery life, though with lower speeds. The key difference is power consumption versus throughput; Classic is for streaming, BLE for efficiency in IoT and tracking, with BLE 5.0 also supporting audio via LE Audio.
